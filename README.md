# TACT NFT standard implement with Staking (Working in Progress)

This is the project that can help you easily deploy an NFT collection on TON blockchain! (\*In test-net)

> You can stake NFT items in the staking contract and then claim the TON coins within the contract based on the share you have!


Remember to go to `depoly.ts` to change the parameters you want!

```bash
yarn build # To build contract
yarn deploy # To deploy contract
yarn test # To test contract..?
```
